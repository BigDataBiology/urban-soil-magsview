## Urban soil microbiome

> _Long-read metagenomic sequencing reveals novel lineages and functional 
> diversity in urban soil microbiome_ by Yiqian Duan, Anna Cuscó, Chengkai Zhu,

City parks and other urban green spaces can bring significant benefits to the 
physical and mental health of city residents. Most studies of the urban soil 
microbiome so far have used short-read sequencing, which breaks up genomes and 
misses important pieces like ribosomal genes and mobile elements.

For this project, we used deep long-read sequencing (ONT), polished with
short reads (Illumina) on 58 soil samples from university campuses, parks 
located in two major cities from China. This gave us **7,949 high-quality genomes** 
from **4,171 different species**. In total, 1,060 MAGs are close to finished 
quality, _often better than the available reference genomes_.

In addition to the genomes, we revealed extensive secondary metabolic capacity and 
uncovered over 2 million small protein families.
