Dogs are part of the family, and learning about their gut microbes can tell us
a lot about both their health and the household they live in. Most studies of
the dog gut microbiome so far have used short-read sequencing, which breaks
up genomes and misses important pieces like mobile elements, resistance genes,
and ribosomal genes.

![Shanghai dog](/Fig1a.svg)

For this project, we used deep long-read sequencing (ONT), polished with
short reads (Illumina) on stool samples from 51 pet dogs in Shanghai. This gave
us **2,676 high-quality genomes** from **320 different bacterial species**. In
total, 72% of them are close to finished quality, _often better than the
available reference genomes_.

![Shanghai dog](/Fig1e.svg)

When we compared our data to other dog microbiome datasets from around the
world, we found strong overlap (with over 90% of reads mapping to our genomes),
showing that what we see in _Shanghai dogs reflects pet dogs globally_.

In addition to the genomes, we recovered circular extrachromosomal elements and
built gene catalogs (including a catalog of putative small proteins).
