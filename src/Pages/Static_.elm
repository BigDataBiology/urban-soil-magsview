## Urban soil microbiome

This was a project led by _Yiqian Duan_ (Fudan University) in the [Big Data Biology Lab](https://big-data-biology.org) led by _Luis Pedro Coelho_. The project is currently being finalized for publication. The data will also be made available at a suitable repository.

Please contact us if you are interested in the data: [yqduan20@fudan.edu.cn](mailto:yqduan20@fudan.edu.cn) or [luispedro@big-data-biology.org](mailto:luispedro@big-data-biology.org).

### MAG catalogue

The MAG catalogue includes:

1. The MAGs themselves, in FASTA format.
2. A table with the MAGs, their size, completeness, contamination, and other statistics.
3. Ribosomal genes of MAGs. 

### Gene catalogue

The gene catalogue includes:

1. The set of genes after clustering at 100% amino acid identity, in FASTA format.
2. Eggnog-mapper annotations for the genes.
3. RGI annotations for the genes (Antimicrobial Resistance Genes).
4. The table contains the genes and the contigs from which they originate.

### Small protein catalogue

The small protein catalogue includes:

1. The set of small proteins after clustering at 100% amino acid identity, in FASTA format.
2. The table contains the small proteins and the contigs from which they originate.

### Other tables

Other tables, including contextual data tables, will be available as
Supplementary Tables in the manuscript.
