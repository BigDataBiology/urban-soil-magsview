## Shanghai dog gut microbiome

This was a project led by _Anna Cuscó_ (Fudan University) in the [Big Data Biology Lab](https://big-data-biology.org) led by _Luis Pedro Coelho_. The project is currently being finalized for publication. The data will also be made available at a suitable repository.

Please contact us if you are interested in the data: [anna@big-data-biology.org](mailto:anna@big-data-biology.org) or [luispedro@big-data-biology.org](mailto:luispedro@big-data-biology.rorg).

### MAG catalogue

The MAG catalogue includes:

1. The MAGs themselves, in FASTA format.
2. Eggog-mapper annotations for the MAGs.
3. RGI annotations for the MAGs (Antimicrobial Resistance Genes).
4. A table with the MAGs, their size, completeness, contamination, and other statistics.


### Extra-chromosomal elements

We provide a catalogue of extra-chromosomal elements, including plasmids.

1. The sequences themselves, in FASTA format.
2. A table with information including putative host prediction, element type classification (plasmid, phage, or unclassified).
3. Eggog-mapper annotations for the sequences.


### Gene catalogue

The gene catalogue includes three levels of redudancy removal:

1. The initial set of open reading frames (ORFs) predicted by Prodigal.
2. The set of ORFs after clustering at 100% nucleotide identity.
3. The set of ORFs after clustering at 95% nucleotide identity (unigenes).

As a resource for download, we provide:

1. The genes themselves, in FASTA format; including both nucleotides and amino acids versions.
2. Eggog-mapper annotations for the genes.
3. The clustering table.

### Small protein catalogue

Unlike the gene catalogue, which is completely _denovo_, the small protein
catalogue is based on mapping to the [Global Microbial Smorf
Catalogue](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51894-6).

As a resource for download, we provide:

1. The small proteins themselves, in FASTA format, both 100% and 90% amino acid identity.
2. Clustering tables for the small proteins, at 100% and 90% amino acid identity.

### Other tables

Other tables, including contextual data tables, will be available as
Supplementary Tables in the manuscript.
