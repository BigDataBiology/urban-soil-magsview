# MAGs View

A simple web interface to visualize and explore metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), their taxonomic classification and functional annotations.

## Local development

This is based on [elm-land](https://elm-lang.org/).

```bash
# Requires Node.js v18+ (https://nodejs.org)
npx elm-land server
```

## Using a different MAG catalog

See [docs/adapting-mags.md](docs/adapting-mags.md) for instructions on swapping in your
own MAG metadata and per-genome JSON files.
